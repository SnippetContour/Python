# COMMENTS
# Use the pound symbol (#) to create comments,
# Comments are necessary at times, sometimes comments are dispensable
# Some never use comments, some despise them, however, many languages support them.
# Comments can get nasty, comments are sometimes hairy,
# Avoid creating inline comments, where you have the bit of code followed by a comment,
# But that is supported too, just avoid it.
# As time passes, you realize when there is a good place for a comment,
# But for now, use them excessively as personal notes.
# When using code comments professionally use common sense.
# Code comments should only be used for complex code bits, otherwise
# Your code should be clear and explicit (see The Zen Of Python: https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)
# According to PEP8 a line should be limited to 79 characters, including comments
